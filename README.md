# chromeStorage
A wrapper around `localStorage` & `chrome.storage.sync`. Provides chrome's storage features (syncing, multiple assignments, ...) without the cumbersome asynchronous API, i.e., without callbacks to get a value.

More information to come when it's actually working.

## Testing
This whole repositoriy is a Chrome extension meant for testing. Load the folder into chrome (load unpacked extension) and open the options page (`test.html`). Tests will run automatically. Refresh page to run the tests again.

Uses [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) for testing.
